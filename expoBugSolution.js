The solution involves a multi-step debugging process:

1. **Verify Device/Simulator Connection:** Ensure the device or simulator is properly connected and recognized by your system. Check USB connectivity, network settings, and simulator configuration.
2. **Check Expo CLI Version:** Update Expo CLI to the latest version using `npm update -g expo-cli`.
3. **Clean and Rebuild:** Remove the existing build cache using `expo prebuild --clean` and then rebuild the application using `expo prebuild` or `expo start`.
4. **Examine the Logs:** Carefully examine the output from the Expo CLI. The error message may contain clues about the underlying cause. Look for network issues, permission errors, or build failures.
5. **Inspect Project Configuration:** Check your `app.json` or `expo.json` file for potential configuration problems. Verify compatibility with your chosen device or simulator.
6. **Check Dependencies:** Update or reinstall project dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install` to resolve possible dependency conflicts.
7. **Check Network Connectivity:** Ensure that your device or simulator has a stable network connection if the app requires internet access.
8. **Restart and Retry:** Sometimes, simple restarts of the Expo CLI, the development machine, or the device/simulator can resolve transient errors. 
9. **Advanced Troubleshooting:** If the issue remains unresolved, explore more advanced debugging techniques, such as using debugging tools or consulting the Expo documentation for platform-specific issues.

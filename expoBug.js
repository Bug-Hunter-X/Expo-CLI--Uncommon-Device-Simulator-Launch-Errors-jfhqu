This error typically occurs when using the Expo CLI and attempting to run your application on a device or simulator that isn't properly configured or compatible with your project setup.  It might manifest as a generic error message or a more specific error related to network connectivity, device permissions, or build issues.  Debugging this requires systematically checking your environment and project settings.
